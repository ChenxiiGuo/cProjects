I choose the second one. Decode a picture to teltext.

SDL_image is needed.

How to using makefile:

1. using make base, to get the base that can change m7 to gif. argv[1] is test.m7
2. make ext, to get the ext that can change gif to m7(rev.m7). argv[1] is test_m7.gif
3. make printtest, to get the printtest that can compare the picture generated by rev.m7 with standard gif file(like your test_m7.gif).

So generally, you use ./ext name.gif then you get a m7 file called rev.m7. Then you can use ./base rev.m7 to check by eye. You can also use ./printtest rev.m7 test_m7.gif to check it automatically.

My strategy is to read the gif into a color set which is a 2-d array. Then I will calculate every small
cells' hash value and compare it with the fontfile or other library.  So I can get the character and graphs. 
The most difficult part is tell the difference between 0xff in graph model and new background.
My strategy is to check whether current cells' background colour appears in next cell. If it appears, I will assert that it if oxff.
Anothoer difficult part is check holding. If in graphic model, I will calculate the hash value of current cell, previous cell and next cell to decide whether it is holding.
