# cProjects

Currently there are two different projects. One is TelTextParser, the other is binarySearchTree.

## Introduction of TelTextParser

### What it is used for?

It has three different telToImage, imageToTel and testing.

telToImage is used to parse the [Teletext](http://www.bbcbasic.co.uk/tccgen/manual/tcgen2.html) code to image like [this](http://teletext.mb21.co.uk/gallery/ceefax/main1.shtml).

imageToTel is used to read an image like [this](http://teletext.mb21.co.uk/gallery/ceefax/main1.shtml) to Teletext.

test is used to test my code.

### How to used it?

Every folder has a makefile, you can use it to compile and run.

### Features of TelTexParser

For telToImage, this software is based on the concept "finite state machine". I assume that each instruction in Teletext will
not influence previous instructions' result. As a result, I take the code as FSM.  There are some test instructions like lfc.m7ï¼Œ
panda.m7. You could run code to test them.

For imageToTel, actually this is an image recognition software. It is a very diffcult one.

There are 3 steps to do the recognition.

First, cutting the image to unit image(This small image is generated by each instruction).

Second, calculating the index or hash_value of each unit image.

Finally, comparing this index with each instruction's index(which is already calculated) and get the index.
